title: About Me
---

My name is Miles and I am passionate about solving problems efficiently and elegantly and helping other
people do the same. My background wasn't originally in computer science, but I now have nearly 10 years
of experience in the field, and specialize in data processing pipelines, distributed computing, and
functional programming.

Besides software I'm always looking for new ways to grow, whether it's athletically, or in mindfulness
you'll find me looking for the next adventure to stretch my world view.

## Hire Me
