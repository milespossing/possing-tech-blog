[Just](https://just.systems/) is one of those tiny tiny tools built in rust
which I absolutely love.

It's polished, bright, quick, and best of all, it solves _exactly_ one issue.

## A departure from Make

I've been a make user for many years. You'll find make in most of my projects at work
(although if the Makefile isn't already there, I'll sometimes keep it in my ignore).
And at school, particularly for courses such as Parallel Programming (a very c++ course)
or several ML courses (requiring a lot of annoying orchestration)
