      <description>Question How did you get involved or gain knowledge about Royalties so quickly when joining the team?
Answer There are probably multiple answers to this question. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to unpack my thoughts systematically.
The first answer is probably that I didn&amp;rsquo;t, at the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the ROCX team for 2 years, depending on who you ask, that&amp;rsquo;s a long time to be on any team. So my knowledge didn&amp;rsquo;t come over night and my specific experience on the team obviously gives me much more insight than I had even a year ago.</description>
